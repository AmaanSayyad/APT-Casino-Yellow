# APT Casino - Yellow Network Integration Demo Video Script

## Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Show APT Casino logo and Yellow Network logo]**

**Narrator:** "Welcome to APT Casino, now powered by Yellow Network's state channel technology. In this demo, we'll show you how we've integrated Yellow Network's Nitrolite SDK and ERC-7824 state channels to create a gasless, high-performance casino gaming experience."

**[Show split screen of before/after integration]**

**Narrator:** "Before our integration, every game interaction required an on-chain transaction, resulting in high gas fees and slow gameplay. Now, with Yellow Network, players enjoy instant, gasless interactions while maintaining the security and fairness of blockchain technology."

## Yellow Network Integration Overview (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Show architecture diagram]**

**Narrator:** "Our integration leverages Yellow Network's state channel technology through three main components:"

**[Highlight each component as mentioned]**

1. "Channel Management - for secure off-chain communication"
2. "Game Sessions - for managing game state and interactions"
3. "Verifiable Random Function - for provably fair randomness"

**Narrator:** "Let's see these components in action."

## Channel Creation and Management (1:00 - 1:30)

**[Show Channel Manager UI]**

**Narrator:** "Players start by creating or connecting to a Yellow Network channel. This establishes the secure off-chain communication pathway."

**[Demonstrate channel creation process]**

**Narrator:** "Notice how the channel is created instantly, with no blockchain transaction required. The channel will be used for all game interactions, enabling gasless gameplay."

## Game Session Creation (1:30 - 2:00)

**[Show Game Session Manager UI]**

**Narrator:** "Next, we create a game session for the specific game we want to play. In this case, we're creating a session for the Mines game."

**[Demonstrate game session creation]**

**Narrator:** "The game session is created instantly through the Yellow Network state channels. This session will manage all game state and interactions off-chain."

## Playing the Mines Game (2:00 - 3:00)

**[Show successful win and payout]**

**Narrator:** "When we win, the payout is calculated and credited instantly through the state channel. No need to wait for blockchain confirmations."

## Verifiable Random Function (3:00 - 3:30)

**[Show VRF tab in Yellow Network panel]**

**Narrator:** "One of the most important aspects of casino games is provably fair randomness. We've migrated from Chainlink VRF to Yellow Network state channels for this critical function."

**[Demonstrate VRF generation]**

**Narrator:** "Here we can see VRF proofs being generated through Yellow Network. These proofs ensure that game outcomes are random and verifiable, maintaining the integrity of the games."

## Game History and Verification (3:30 - 4:00)

**[Show game history with Yellow Network VRF proofs]**

**Narrator:** "Each game result is recorded with its Yellow Network VRF proof, allowing players to verify the fairness of each outcome. This maintains the transparency of blockchain while enjoying the speed of state channels."

**[Demonstrate clicking on a game history item to show VRF proof details]**

**Narrator:** "Players can click on any game to see the detailed VRF proof information, ensuring complete transparency."

## Benefits and Conclusion (4:00 - 4:30)

**[Show split screen comparing before/after metrics]**
